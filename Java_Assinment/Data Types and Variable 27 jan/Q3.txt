Q3. How to assign a value to variable?

ans:- 
1. The first time a variable is assigned a value, it is said to be initialised.
 
2.The "=" symbol is known as the assignment operator. It is also possible to declare a variable and assign it a value in the same line.

Example:-  so instead of
				 int i;
		and then     i = 9;
 
		you can write 
				int i = 9;
		  
		all in one go.
